## Hi there, you can call me Aga👋

I live in Poland! I'm Aga — a curious mind on a journey through the world of technology. 💻
I’m always learning, step by step, even when new technologies love to challenge me and test my patience. 😅
Mistakes happen, bugs appear, and things don’t always go as planned — but that’s part of the adventure. 🤠

With every project, I aim to grow, to understand a little more, and to build something a little better.
Outside of coding, I find inspiration in art & travel — because balance is key. 🎨🌍

This space is a reflection of perseverance, learning, and small victories along the way.
Thanks for stopping by — feel free to join me on this journey! ✨

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Power BI, UML and advanced AI
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe coffee and curiosity are the perfect fuel for coding. ☕🚀
